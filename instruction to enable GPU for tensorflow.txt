1. Check supported versions of CuDNN and CUDA for tensorflow
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu

2. Install Microsoft Visual Studio (Is it really necessary???)
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/cs/vs/community/

3. Install NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit into default folder
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exe_network

4. Extract NVIDIA cuDNN and copy those 3 folders into Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v11.0
https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download

5. Download Zlib and put the zlibwapi.dll into C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
    It was enough to put there only the one mentioned .dll file

5. add those paths into environmental variables (PATH)
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp
C:\...\zlibwapi.dll

6. pip install Tensorflow

hint:
all those files I downloaded the most up to date.
make sure that CUDA and cuDNN are compatible when it comes to theirs version
