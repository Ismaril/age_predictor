# Age prediction Machine Learning project
### Complete ML project including datascraping, feature engineering, modelling, ..., and deploying via GUI interface

Description of steps taken, chronologically:
1. Looking for potential websites with available faces and corresponding ages (IMDB.com, Tinder.com)
2. Checking structure of chosen website/s and html, to find the easiest way to scrape data
    * IMDB contained besides others actor_data.txt with all it's actors, ids, ages - this saved a lot of potential web crawling
3. Data analysis on actor_data.txt 
4. Programming a scrapper - requests via Tor
5. Cleaning and preparing downloaded data
